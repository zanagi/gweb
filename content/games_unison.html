          GAME JAM-SIZED GAME MADE FOR AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE UNDERSTANDING MEDIA, ART AND DESIGN
          A RELAXING GAME WHERE YOU GATHER SOUND FRAGMENTS AROUND THE MAP TO BUILD
          A MELODY. <br><br>
          UNISON WAS DESIGNED TO BE PART OF A 2-DAY EXHIBITION BY THE MEDIA LAB OF AALTO UNIVERSITY,
          WHERE THE THE VISITORS WOULD COLLECTIVELY GATHER DIFFERENT SOUNDS AND PRODUCE
          A COMBINED MELODY ACROSS THE WHOLE DURATION OF THE EXHIBITION.
          <br><br>
          THE GAME WAS MADE WITH UNITY 3D IN A GROUP OF 7 AND I WAS ONE OF THE GAMEPLAY PROGRAMMERS.
